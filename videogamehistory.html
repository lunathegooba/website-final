      <h2>1952</h2>
      <p>Video games started in a research lab full of scientists.In 1952, a British professor, A.S. Douglas created “OXO” (A version of tic tac toe) as part of his doctoral dissertation at the university of cambridge.

      <h2>1958</h2>
      <p>Tennis for Two (also known as the first ever video game made), was created by an American physicist William Higinbotham in 1958. It was made on a large analog computer and connected to an oscilloscope screen for the annual visitor’s day at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in Uptown, New York.

      <h2>1962</h2>
      <p>Steve Russell at the Massachusetts institute of technology invented “Space war!” a computer based-combat video game for the PDP-1. This was the first video game that could be played on multiple computer installations.

      <h2>1967</h2>
      <p>developers at Sanders Associates, Inc., led by Ralph Baer, invented a prototype multiplayer, multi-program video game system that could be played on a television. It was known as “The Brown Box.”  </p>

      <h2>1972</h2>
      <p> Baer, who’s sometimes referred to as the Father of Video Games, licensed his device to Magnavox, which sold the system to consumers as the Odyssey, the first video game home console, in 1972. Over the next few years, the primitive Odyssey console would commercially fizzle and die out.
      Yet, one of the Odyssey’s 28 games was the inspiration for Atari’s “Pong”, the first arcade video game, which the company released in 1972.

      <p>Atari released a home version of Pong, which was as successful as its arcade counterpart. 
        Magnavox, along with Sanders Associates, would eventually sue Atari for copyright infringement. Atari settled and became an Odyssey licensee; over the next 20 years, Magnavox went 
        on to win more than $100 million in copyright lawsuits related to the Odyssey and its video game patents.

         a home console that featured joysticks and interchangeable game cartridges that played 
         multi-colored games, effectively kicking off the second generation of video game consoles.

      <h2>1983</h2>
      <p>In 1983, the North American video game industry experienced a major “crash” due to a number of
         factors, including an oversaturated game console market, competition from computer gaming, and a 
         surplus of over-hyped, low-quality games, such as the infamous E.T., an Atari game based on the 
         eponymous movie and often considered the worst game ever created.

      <h2>1985 - The Industry's Recovery</h2>
      <p>
        Lasting a couple of years, the crash led to the bankruptcy of several home computer and video
         game console companies.The video game home industry began to recover in 1985 when the Nintendo
          Entertainment System (NES), called Famicom in Japan, came to the United States. The NES had improved
           8-bit graphics, colors, sound and gameplay over previous consoles.

      <h2>1989 - Nintendo's Flourishing</h2>
      <p>
        Nintendo, a Japanese company that began as a playing card manufacturer in 1889, released a number 
        of important video game franchises still around today, such as Super Mario Bros., The Legend of Zelda,
         and Metroid.Additionally, Nintendo imposed various regulations on third-party games developed for its
          system, helping to combat rushed, low-quality software. Third-party developers released many other 
          long-lasting franchises, such as Capcom’s Mega Man, Konami’s Castlevania, Square’s Final Fantasy, and 
          Enix’s Dragon Quest (Square and Enix would later merge to form Square Enix in 2003).In 1989,
           Nintendo made waves again by popularizing handheld gaming with the release of its 8-bit Game Boy
            video game device and the often-bundled game Tetris.

      <h2>1989</h2>
      <p>
       Over the next 25 years, Nintendo would release a number of successful successors to the Game Boy,
        including the Game Boy Color in 1998, Nintendo DS in 2004, and Nintendo 3DS in 2011

      <p>
  Also in 1989, Sega released its 16-bit Genesis console in North America as a successor 
  to its 1986 Sega Master System, which failed to adequately compete against the NES.

      <h2>1991</h2>
      <p>
With its technological superiority to the NES, clever marketing, and the 1991 release of the 
Sonic the Hedgehog game, the Genesis made significant headway against its older rival. In 1991, 
Nintendo released its 16-bit Super NES console in North America, launching the first real “console war.”
The early to mid-1990s saw the release of a wealth of popular games on both consoles, including new franchises
 such as Street Fighter II and Mortal Kombat, a fighting game that depicted blood and gore on the
  Genesis version of the game.

      <h2>1993</h2>
      <p>
  In response to the violent game (as well as congressional hearings about violent video games), Sega 
  created the Video Game Rating Council in 1993 to provide descriptive labeling for every game sold on a 
  Sega home console. The council later gave rise to the industry-wide Entertainment Software Rating Board,
   which is still used today to rate video games based on content.In the mid-1990s, video games leaped to the
    Big Screen with the release of the Super Mario Bros. live-action movie in 1993, followed by Street Fighter 
    and Mortal Kombat over the next two years. Numerous movies based on video games have been released since.With 
    a much larger library of games, a lower price point, and successful marketing, the Genesis had leapfrogged
     ahead of the SNES in North America by this time. But Sega was unable to find similar success in Japan.

      <h1>The Rise of 3D Gaming</h1>
      <h2>1995</h2>
      <p>
  In 1995, Sega released its Saturn system in North America, the first 32-bit console that played games
   on CDs rather than cartridges, five months ahead of schedule. This move was to beat Sony’s first foray 
   into video games, the PlayStation, which sold for $100 less than the Saturn when it launched later that
    year. The following year, Nintendo released its cartridge-based 64-bit system, the Nintendo 64.Though Sega 
    and Nintendo each released their fair share of highly-rated, on-brand 3D titles, such as Virtua Fighter on
     the Saturn and Super Mario 64 on the Nintendo 64, the established video game companies couldn’t compete
      with Sony’s strong third-party support, which helped the PlayStation secure numerous exclusive titles.

      <h2>2001-2002</h2>
      <p>
 The PlayStation 2, which was the first console that used DVDs, went up against the 
 Sega Dreamcast (released in 1999), the Nintendo GameCube (2001), and Microsoft’s Xbox (2001).The
  Dreamcast—considered by many to be ahead of its time and one of the greatest consoles ever made for 
  several reasons, including its capability for online gaming—was a commercial flop that ended Sega’s console 
  efforts. Sega pulled the plug on the system in 2001, becoming a third-party software company henceforth.

      <h2>2005-2006</h2>
      <p>
In 2005 and 2006, Microsoft’s Xbox 360, Sony’s PlayStation 3, and Nintendo’s Wii kicked off the modern age of 
high-definition gaming. Though the PlayStation 3—the only system at the time to play Blu-rays—was successful
 in its own right, Sony, for the first time, faced stiff competition from its rivals.

    <div class="content">
      <h2>2007</h2>
      <p>
The Xbox 360, which had similar graphics capabilities to the Playstation 3, was lauded for its online gaming
 ecosystem and won far more Game Critics Awards than the other platforms in 2007; it also featured the 
 Microsoft Kinect, a state-of-the-art motion capture system that offered a different way to play video games
  (though the Kinect never caught on with core gamers or game developers).And despite being technologically
   inferior to the other two systems, the Wii trounced its competition in sales. Its motion-sensitive remotes 
   made gaming more active than ever before, helping it appeal to a much larger slice of the general public, 
   including people in retirement homes.

      <h2>Late 2000s-early 2010s</h2>
      <p>
        Towards the end of the decade and beginning of the next, video games spread to social media
         platforms like Facebook and mobile devices like the iPhone, reaching a more casual gaming audience. 
         Rovio, the company behind the Angry Birds mobile device game (and, later Angry Birds animated movie),
          reportedly made a whopping $200 million in 2012.In 2011, Skylanders: Spyro’s Adventure brought video
           games into the physical world. The game required players to place plastic toy figures (sold separately)
             onto an accessory, which reads the toys’ NFC tags to bring the characters into the game. 
             The next few years would see several sequels and other toy-video game hybrids, such as Disney Infinity,
              which features Disney characters.

      <h2>2017</h2>
      <p>
In early 2017, Nintendo released its Wii U successor, the Nintendo Switch, the only system to allow both
 television-based and handheld gaming. Microsoft released its 4K-ready console, the Xbox One X, in late 2017,
  and followed up in 2020 with the Xbox Series X and Series S.

      <h2>2020</h2>
      <p>
 In 2020, Sony released the PlayStation 5, a successor to the PlayStation 4.With their new revamped
  consoles, both Sony and Microsoft currently have their sights set on virtual reality gaming, a technology 
  that has the potential to change the way players experience video games. As video games continue to be developed,
  advancements will be made faster than ever before, but the legacy of video games from the past will never be forgotten.
